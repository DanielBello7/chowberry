NOTES;
- whenever a withdrawal is made the status is set to pending, which means 
the withdrawal is waiting for an approval from the admin of the application,
once the admin approves the withdrawal the status is changed to processing,
this is when the cron-job can get it and try the payment, if after 3 tries 
it still fails, the status is set to failed and the removed funds are 
refunded back to the wallet where they were withdrawn from. if successful
the status is set to completed and a payout record is created.

- the person entity was created because of the family relationship system,
so as to keep record of who is connected to who and what is the relationship
between these people, why it was separated and beneficiary wasn't used 
directly was because of situations where the family member of a new registered
beneficiary might not be a beneficiary or might not want to be a beneficiary,
so we need to differentiate between the beneficiaries and non beneficiaries,
but still keep the relationship simple
